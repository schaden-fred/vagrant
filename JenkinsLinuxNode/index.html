This vagrantfile starts up a Centos 7 VM, configures and secures SSHD, installs maven, epel, nodejs, and phantomjs.
The latest stable jenkins.war is downloaded to ~vagrant.
The repo https://github.com/g0t4/jenkins2-course-spring-boot.git is cloned to ~vagrant/jenkins2/

The completed VM will be useful for anyone taking Wes Highbee's "Getting Started with Jenkins" course located here.
